With the Shan Shui painting as the background, an elegant dance track is recorded. The two dancers dance to the beat of the music, and the handles in their hands collect the dynamics of their bodies.

By visualizing the trajectory of the two dancers and connecting their movements, we can fine hidden communications between dancers. By recording the trajectory and speed of the two dancers' hand movements, two trajectories can be formed. We visualize the two trajectories as ribbons. The faster the dance speed, the wider the width of the ribbons.

A special moment of connection in dancing is when the dancers move at the same direction at the same time. We visualized those moments of synchronicity by connecting their positions and directions. Therefore we can get the visual structure of connection in a daning movement.
